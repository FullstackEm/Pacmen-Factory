# Pacmen-Factory
MIT pro Fullstack development certificate Excercise. 
Description of the project: In this exercise we were tasked with creating javascript that allowed us to use an onclick event to create more elements. The Pacmen images were provided, and we used the javascript to allow us to create an array of new objects to allow each click of add pacman to add more pacmen, when you click start game, the images move around the screen at random speeds and positions.
Roadmap of future improvements: This exercise allowed me to work on debugging my code and getting the buttons to function appropriately.
